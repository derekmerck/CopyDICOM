# CopyDICOM

## Overview

`CopyDICOM` is a python script that monitors an installation of Jodogne's [Orthanc][] and copies DICOM imaging to another instance of Orthanc or DICOM tags to a [Splunk][] index.  It can also reduce DICOM structured report tags into a format following Orthanc's 'simplified-tags' presentation.  This can be useful for parsing data from dose reports in a tag index.

`CopyDICOM` is intended to be used as an adjunct with an automatic DICOM data analytics framework, specifically [DIANA][], but it works well as a stand alone tool, with somewhat more intelligent copying than Orthanc's standard `Replicate.py` script.  In particular, it does not attempt to replicate data that is already extant at the destination, and working with a tag index, it can selectively copy subsets of image data based on complex queries.

## Dependencies

- Python 2.7
- Requests


## Usage

To use it as a stand-alone script:

````bash
$ docker run docker run -d -p 8042:8042 jodogne/orthanc
$ docker run docker run -d -p 8043:8042 jodogne/orthanc
$ python CopyDICOM.py replicate 
>  --src  'http://orthanc:orthanc@localhost:8042' \
>  --dest 'http://orthanc:orthanc@localhost:8043'
````

````bash
$ docker run docker run -d -p 8088:8088 outcoldman/splunk
$ python CopyDICOM.py replicate_tags 
>  --src   'http://orthanc:orthanc@localhost:8042' \
>  --index 'https://admin:changeme@localhost:8089' \
>  --hec   'http://Splunk:<token>@localhost:8088
````

````bash
$ python CopyDICOM.py conditional_replicate 
>  --src   'http://orthanc:orthanc@localhost:8042' \
>  --index 'https://admin:changeme@localhost:8089' \
>  --query 'search index=dicom | spath SeriesDescription | search SeriesDescription="Dose Record" | spath ID | table ID' \ 
>  --dest  'http://orthanc:orthanc@localhost:8043'
````

To use it as a Python library in a script:

````python
>>> import CopyDICOM
>>> CopyDICOM.replicate(src='http://orthanc:orthanc@localhost:8042', dest='http://orthanc:orthanc@localhost:8043')
````


## Functionality

* `replicate`: copy all non-duplicate DICOM images from a source Orthanc instance to a destination Orthanc instance
* `replicate_tags`: copy all non-duplicate DICOM tags from a source Orthanc instance to a Splunk index
* `conditional_replicate`: Query a Splunk index for a set of candidate instances, and copy non-duplicate DICOM images in that set from a source Orthanc instance to a destination Orthanc instance.

`conditional_replicate` is intended to allow automatic duplication of specific image types from a primary archive into secondary, project specific DICOM stores, typically with a de-identifier on ingestion.  In DIANA, such secondary image repositories are called "Anonymized Image Archives" or "AIRs".


## Utilization and Dose Reporting with Splunk

A simple Splunk query can create a _Count of Studies by Modality by Day_ dashboard from the tag data.

```
index=dicom | spath ID | spath SeriesDescription | spath StudyDescription | dedup ID | stats count by SeriesDescription StudyDescription
```

If structured dose reports are included in the archive monitored by `CopyDICOM replicate_tags`, the dose data will also be available for a Splunk dashboard, such as reviewing _Dose by Protocol_.  This is a particularly useful function to the Diagnostic Imaging department at RIH for auditing our quarterly ACR Dose Reports.

For very long, complex dose reports, may need to alter `_json` source type with a new variable: `TRUNCATE=999999` to beat the 10k char limit on a single line.

## Testing

An [Ansible][] playbook is included that sets up local Docker containers for an Orthanc source (8042), and Orthanc destination (8043), and a Splunk index (8000/8089) for testing.  Sample data is automatically loaded into the Orthanc source, but the paths are currently hardcoded for my development system, so other users will need to modify them.

[Ansible]: https://github.com/ansible/ansible

````bash
$ ansible-playbook testbench.yml 
````

Then login to `http://admin:changeme@localhost:8000` and add indices and get a HEC token.  It seems to work best to turn off the global SSL on the HEC inputs, as well.

## Dose Data

For any accession, any series = 997 is ONLY dose data series = 997
